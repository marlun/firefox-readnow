firefox-readnow
===============

Firefox extension for changing the typography of the main body of text on site.

Tools like Pocket and Readability is great for saving and making text more readable but they both move the text out of its original place. This extension keeps the text where it should be but changes the font to make it more readable.

You can change all of the style changes on the addon page (Shift-Command-A on OS X and Shift-Ctrl-A on Windows and Linux).
